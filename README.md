# organization

The 1st$n program was created by Alan Glennon, PhD (an angel investor) and Yury Lifshits (CEO Openland, YC W18) to discover underrepresented and underestimated founders. In itself, 1st$n does not generate revenue. Alan benefits through his personal investments he makes through the site. Yury benefits from the development of a community of great startup founders at Openland.
We are developing a program for Venture Scouts to help us on our mission! You can learn more by contacting scouts@firstmoney.in

As founders, be aware that "first money" is not easy to get. Alan Glennon tends to invest in 1 of 500 pitches he evaluates. The other angels likely fall within the same order of magnitide. Fortunately, with multiple angels independently considering your application, we anticipate the likelihood of investment will be similar to a top-tier accelerator. Angels invest when they believe your team, your abilities, your product, and the market can lead to a massive return. We are excited you have chosen to become an entrepreneur. Best wishes on your path!
