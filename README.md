# FirstMoney.In Organizing Documents

[FirstMoney.In](https://firstmoney.in) (1st$n) is a program for startup founders to apply to experienced startup angel investors on a standard deal of $5,000 in return for 0.2% of your company. It is designed to facilitate access to capital for never-before-funded companies, especially those led by founders who identify as Women, BIPOC, and/or LGBTQ+. All startups are welcome and encouraged to apply.

While most venture capital requires founders to sell a large stake to investors, the 1st$n deal is purposely modest and as simple as possible. The program uses a standard deal: a $5,000 investment with a $2.5 million cap on a SAFE: Valuation Cap, no Discount. The investment purchases 0.2% equity in your company. In the application, you may optionally request to sell more of your company for a $10,000 or $25,000 investment. 1st$n is not affiliated with Y Combinator in any way, but the program uses their verbatim SAFE document for the financing agreement.

The 1st$n program was created by Alan Glennon, PhD (an [angel investor](https://angel.co/glennon)) and Yury Lifshits (CEO [Openland](https://openland.com), YC W18) to discover underrepresented and underestimated founders. In itself, 1st$n does not generate revenue. Alan benefits through his personal investments he makes through the site. Yury benefits from the development of a community of great startup founders at Openland.

The project is being organized in the open at Openland.com in the [Future of Preseed](https://openland.com/invite/FQC3JNW) group.

Angel investors associated with the project are followed by the 1st$n [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/firstmoneyin/following).
